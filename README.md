## User story
As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform and I want it to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API so that my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.

## User experience
Given an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state, when I review the appâ€™s store I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API.

When I review the way the React front end accesses the store, then I find that the app uses a Redux provider.

When I review the way the app determines changes to its global state, then I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API.

When I review the way the app extracts state data from the store, then I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.

When I review the way the app dispatches actions, then I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
